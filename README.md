# Power BI Desktop Training Lab

This is a simple Power BI Desktop training to learn the basics of the tool. 


## Data connection

Connect to the .csv and .xlsx files provided in the [Data](data/) folder and import the following files: 
- [Products.csv](data/Products.csv) - Information about the products
- [France.csv](data/France.csv) - Sales data for France
- [Belgium.csv](data/Belgium.csv) - Sales data for Belgium
- [Austria.csv](data/Austria.csv) - Sales data for Austria

Note: The Manufacturer.xlsx file is not required. 

To connect, you can either download the files and use the "Text/CSV" connector to import the data, or you can alternatively use the Web connector and directly import from the link. For this to work, you need to select "View raw" after selecting a file in Github.

After following the steps, the four tables (queries) should be visible in your Power Query editor.
